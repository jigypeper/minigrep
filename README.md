# minigrep
simple grep implementation in rust

## Bio
I am currently working through the Book and Rustlings, finally made it to i/o and file handling.

## Use
This little application searches for words in a file, and prints the results to your console. It has the capability to search case-insensitive also.  
To run this: 
1) clone the repository 
2) Install rust from the rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org
3) create a txt file (and place in the source directory or use relative paths to navigate to it).
4) compile and run:
    i) `cargo run -- pattern ../file.txt`
